\eucommentary{Milestones means control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may
correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin.
They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective
measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for
example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further
development.}



\paragraph{General Milestones}

\begin{milestones}
  \milestone[
    id=startup,
    month=12,
    verif={Goal}
    ]
  {Startup}
  {
  By milestone 1, we will have established the infrastructure
  for the project and begun prototyping development,
  engaging with the existing communities,
  coordinating plans for \TheProject with those of the wider Jupyter and open science communities.
  }

  \milestone[
    id=prototype,
    month=24,
    verif={Goal}
    ]
  {Working prototypes}
  {
  By milestone 2, we will have working prototypes of services
  for open science, and begun to experiment with early-adopter
  users to guide further development of \TheProject,
  ensuring that development serves the needs of the community.
  }

  \milestone[
    id=community,
    month=36,
    verif={Goal}
    ]
  {Community engagement}
  {
  By milestone 3, services should be useful and accessible
  to a broad range of users.
  By this point, we will have training materials and run
  workshops to train users in Open Science,
  gathering feedback to guide the further development of \TheProject.
  }


  \milestone[
    id=final,
    month=48,
    verif={Goal}
  ]
  {Adoption and sustainability}
  {
  By this point, all \TheProject services should be operational, TRL 8.
  Through community engagement via workshops, conferences, and other media,
  the services should have established groups of users,
  benefiting from these services and improving the Open Science landscape
  on EOSC and beyond.
  }
