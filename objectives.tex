The aims of \TheProject are:
\begin{compactenum}[\textbf{Aim} 1:]
\item \label{aim:jupyter}%
  Support (and steer?) the Jupyter ecosystem, as a general purpose
  toolbox for interactive computing and visualization that supports
  the entire life-cycle of open science, from initial exploration to
  publication, engineering (better word(s) about usage in industry
  here?), teaching, and outreach.

\item \label{aim:services}%
  Leverage this technology for all scientists, in Europe and beyond,
  through generic services that are tightly integrated into the EOSC,

\item \label{aim:demonstrators}%
  Demonstrate the value and versatility of such services through
  applications to mathematics, medicine, (... what's done at XFEL),
  ...
\end{compactenum}
