\begin{sitedescription}{UPSUD} \label{desc:ParisSud}

Université Paris-Sud is among the 40 top universities worldwide in the
2013 Shanghai ranking, and is one of the top two French research
universities. With about 27000 students, 1800 permanent faculty
and 1300 permanent research scientists from national research
organisations (CNRS, Inserm, INRA, Inria), it is the largest campus in
France. Since 2006, scientists from the University were awarded two
Fields medals, one Nobel Prize and a number of other national and international prizes
(European Inventor Award 2013, Wolf Prize 2010, Holweck Prize 2009,
Japan prize 2007).  Université Paris-Sud offers a
wide range of qualifications, from the exact sciences to life and health
sciences (including medical practice), legal sciences and economics. 
Research at Université Paris-Sud is an essential part of academic understanding 
and includes research activities with high commercial potential. 
Research contracts and partnership with companies make
Université Paris-Sud a key actor and a major player in French
research.  The University is located partly on the Plateau de Saclay,
the largest cluster of public and private R\&D institutions in France
(with ca. 16000 research staff), and is one of the core members of 
University Paris-Saclay – a world-class university and a
world-renowned research and innovation hub.

In the context of this project, Université Paris-Sud is the
home of one of the largest group of \Sage developers worldwide.
It is a member of the Open Source Thematic Group of the Systematic
Paris Region Systems and ICT Cluster. 
The University also hosts a major research group in Human-Centered Computing
and manages the Digiscope network of high-end visualisation platforms,
which will provide critical assets to the project.

% The main participants have accumulated 15 years of experience of
% collaborative open source software development for mathematics
% leadership, and community animation.

  We will hire an experienced part time project manager to help with
  the overall management during the whole duration of \TheProject.

  To make this into a more attractive full time position, we are
  planning a joint hire with another European project lead by CNRS at
  a nearby institution.
  %Thus, due to administrative constraints within
  % CNRS, this manager will be formally attached to \site{UB}.

\subsubsection*{Significant infrastructure}

\site{UPSUD} hosts the lead developers of the open source
cloud infrastructure \software{Stratuslab} and its reference
infrastructure (400 cores). The participants are regular users
of this infrastructure, and are in close contact with the developers.

\site{UPSUD} also manages the Digiscope (\url{http://digiscope.fr}) network of high-end visualisation platforms and hosts the \software{WILD} and \software{WILDER} platforms, two ultra-high resolution wall-sized displays with motion capture and touch input for conducting research on collaborative human-computer interaction and visualisation of
large datasets.

- [ ] checked that sum of person months put into finance request is
  the same as sum of person months associated with the Work Packages
  (in proposal.tex, as defined as part of the \begin{workpackage}"
  command.

  Take into account person months associated with work package 1, time
  of all staff to be hired and work on the project (including
  investigators). Figure 5 helps with a quick check of the sums over
  different work packages.

- [X] completed site specific resource summary in resources.tex,
  including table of non-staff costs. This is compulsory (EU
  regulations) if the non-staff cost exceed 15% of the total cost, and
  is likely to be the case for most of the partners. We ask everybody
  to do it, to be consistent and show transparently how we have
  planned our total budget.

- [X] Have all our tasks a designated lead institution? Check in the
  Work Packages that all the tasks you are involved in have a
  dedicated lead party. If the lead party is "USO", then use:
  \begin{task}[lead=USO]

- [ ] Have all our deliverables a designated lead institution [using
  the 'lead=' key]?

- [X] In the "Members of the consortium section", have we addressed "a
  description of the legal entity and its main tasks, with an
  explanation of how its profile matches the tasks in the
  proposal"? See Entry for Paris-Sud and Southampton as examples.

- [X] In the Members of the consortium section, have we given
  descriptions of all the people we intend to hire (even if we don't
  know who that is yet).

- [ ] Do all our tasks include us in the list of sites involved?
