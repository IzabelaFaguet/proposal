(UMR7550) of the CNRS and of the Université de Strasbourg. ObAS hosts the 
Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg (Strasbourg astronomical Data 
Centre CDS, http://cds.unistra.fr). Since its creation in 1972, the CDS has

astronomical community with more than 1 million queries/day on average in

Research Infrastructure Roadmap. Since 2006 CDS has been the coordinator,
on behalf of the CNRS, of all the projects funded by the European Commission
