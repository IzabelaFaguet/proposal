  The European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL) Facility GmbH is a
  limited liability company under German law. At present, 11 countries
  are supporting European XFEL through cash and in-kind contributions:
  Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Russia, Slovakia,
  Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. The company is in charge of the
  construction and operation of the European XFEL, a 3.4$\,$km long
  X-ray free-electron laser facility extending from Hamburg to the
  neighbouring town of Schenefeld in the German federal state of
  Schleswig-Holstein. Civil construction started in early 2009; the
  beginning of user operation is planned for 2017. With its repetition
  rate of 27,000 pulses per second and a peak brilliance a billion
  times higher than that of the best synchrotron X-ray radiation
  sources, it is expected that the European XFEL will enable the
  investigation of still open scientific problems in a variety of
  disciplines (physics, structural biology, chemistry, planetary
  science, study of matter under extreme conditions and many others).

  European XFEL, a landmark on the ESFRI Roadmap, is a single site
  X-ray research infrastructure. When operational, 3~beamlines and
  6~experiments will be available for scientific users. The SASE1
  beamline comprises the instruments Single Particles, clusters, and
  Biomolecules and Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SPB/SFX) and
  Femtosecond X-ray Experiments (FXE), SASE 2 includes Materials
  Imaging and Dynamics (MID) and High Energy Density Science (HED) and
  SASE3 Small Quantum Systems (SQS), and Spectroscopy \& Coherent
  Scattering (SCS).
