Dedicated to tackling scientific challenges with long-term impact and of genuine importance to real life, Simula Research Laboratory (Simula) offers an environment that emphasises and promotes basic re­search. At the same time, we are deeply involved in research education and application-driven innova­tion and commercialisation.

Simula was established as a non-profit, limited company in 2001, and is fully owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research. Its research is funded through competitive grants from national funding agencies and the EC, research contracts with industry, and a basic allowance from the state. Simula’s operations are conducted in a seamless integration with the two subsidiaries Simula School of Research and Innovation and Simula Innovation.

At its outset, the laboratory was given the mandate of becoming an internationally leading research institution within se­lect fields in information and communications technology. These fields are (i) communication systems, including cyber-security; (ii) scientific computing, aiming at fast and reliable solutions of mathematical models in biomedicine and geoscience; and (iii) software engineering, focusing on testing and verification of mission-critical software systems, and on planning and cost estimation of large software development projects. Recent evaluations state that Simula has met its challenge and is an acknowledged contributor to top-level research in its focus areas. Specifically, in the 2012 national evaluation of ICT research organised by the Research Council of Norway and conducted by an international expert panel, Simula received the highest average score (4.67) on a 1-5 scale among all evaluated institutions. In comparison, the national average was 3.38. Only five of the 62 research groups evaluated were awarded the top grade (5), and two of these five groups are located at Simula. In the 2017 in-depth evaluation of Simula, all three research areas were evaluated as excellent.

Simula has hosted one Norwegian Centre of Excellence, Center for Biomedical Computing (2007-2017), and is currently hosting one Norwegian Centre for Research-based Innovation, Certus (2011-2018). In addition, we participate as research partner in two other Centres for Research-based Innovation, Centre for Cardiological Innovation (2011-2018), hosted by Oslo University Hospital and Centre for Scalable Data Access (2015-2022), hosted by the University of Oslo. These two centre-oriented schemes are the most prestigious funding instruments offered by the Research Council of Norway.

Recently, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications promoted one of our leading research activities to national status as the Centre for Resilient Networks and Applications, with a specific mandate to monitor the performance and state of the national telecommunication infrastructure. The ministry is also funding the Research Centre for Information and Communication Security, which is a joint enterprise between Simula and the University of Bergen. Since 2005, Simula has also developed a comprehensive industrial R\&D collaboration with Norway’s largest commercial company, Statoil, in the area of geological modelling for oil and gas exploration. These major initiatives are complemented by a significant number of research grants from the Research Council of Norway and the H2020 work programmes, each typically of 2-3 years duration.

\subsubsection*{Education}

Ever since the start-up of Simula, education has been an important part of the laboratory’s operations. Since 2007, educational activities have been anchored in the subsidiary Simula School of Research and Innovation (SSRI), which is co-owned by Simula, Statoil, the Municipality of Bærum, Telenor, SINTEF, and the Norwegian Computing Center. Since SSRI is not a degree-awarding institution, our students are also enrolled in degree programs at collaborating universities in Norway and abroad. Today, about 35 PhD students, 40 master’s students, and 20 postdoctoral fellows are supervised at Simula annually. Since 2001, more than 100 PhD students and 360 master’s students have completed their degrees at Simula.

In addition to overseeing an efficient scheme for supervision of its enrolled students, SSRI complements the university partners’ traditional course portfolio with training aimed at increasing the students’ transferable skills.  In particular, SSRI offers advanced training in effective oral and written dissemination of research, in close collaboration with leading communication expertise at Pennsylvania State University in the United States. SSRI also offers a modular program for professional development, including leadership training.

\subsubsection*{Innovation}

Simula has a strong track record in developing innovative applications in collaboration with industry partners. The fact that all three research areas at Simula host or serve as main partner in a national Centre for Research-based Innovation manifests this position. These three centres involve major international industrial partners, such as GE Healthcare, Medtronic, ABB, IBM, and Cisco, as well as several SMEs.

Simula has since its inception been strongly committed to taking research results one step further and contribute to new and innovative solutions to important problems. Currently, Simula holds significant portions of the shares in 14 commercial companies. Moreover, Simula runs a start-up facility for entrepreneurs (the Simula Garage), which currently counts more than forty projects and is committed to continuously supporting and fostering promising and innovative solutions with commercial potential. The fully owned subsidiary Simula Innovation handles pre-commercial innovation projects, creation and follow-up of company spin-offs, and general support for entrepreneurs.

\subsubsection*{Research ethics and diversity}

All employees at Simula are obliged to respect the Simula Code of Ethics. In addition to organisational measures to prevent conflicts of interest and corruption, to maintain confidentiality, and to support a positive and all-including working environment, this charter states Simula’s adoption of international standards for research ethics. In particular, Simula’s employees shall comply with the guidelines issued by the Norway’s National Committee for Research Ethics in Science and Technology. In addition, Simula’s publication guidelines are based on the Vancouver Convention.

Embracing diversity enhances an organisation's range of experience, ideas and creativity. Diversity is in all its aspects a highly respected value in the Simula culture. Currently, Simula’s workforce is composed of about 150 people spanning more than 30 countries of origin. In total, almost 60\% of the employees have their background from a country abroad, contributing to a multicultural and vibrant research environment. Gender is one important dimension in diversity, and close to 30\% of the scientific positions is filled by females. This ratio is even higher for recruitment positions (PhD and postdoctoral levels). Simula's achievements for improving the gender balance have been noted nationally, and the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research awarded Simula the annual Gender Balance Prize for 2013. This prize includes a 2 million NOK (220,000 EUR) grant to be used for actions supporting gender balance. Simula has signed the Code of Best Practices for Women in ICT, which is part of the Digital Agenda for Europe.
