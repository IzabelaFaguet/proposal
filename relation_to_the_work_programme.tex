\subsection{Relation to the Work Programme}

The \TheProject project addresses the challenges of the ``Prototyping
new innovative services'' call (ID: INFRAEOSC-02-2019).

The Jupyter Project is already widely adopted in numerous communities and used by millions of researchers worldwide.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Journalists} and practitioners of \emph{data-driven journalism},
\item \emph{Research institutions} such as CERN, JRC, and many more, operating institution-wide Jupyter deployment,
\item \emph{Universities} using Jupyter as a teaching platform,
\item \emph{Large cloud providers} building commercial products on the top of Jupyter (Google DataLab, Amazon Sagemaker, Microsoft Azure Notebooks),
\item \emph{Other EOSC projects}. Jupyter is already planned to become an important service on the European Open Science Cloud through the EOSC-04-funded PaNOSC project [1].
\end{itemize}

While these projects are building upon Jupyter, and are being
supported by the core team in their endeavor. Our proposal deals with
developing the next generation of the Jupyter tools, and their
relation with EOSC.

[1] EINFRAOESC-02 call (\url{https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/infraeosc-02-2019;freeTextSearchKeyword=innovative;typeCodes=0,1;statusCodes=31094501,31094502;programCode=null;programDivisionCode=null;focusAreaCode=null;crossCuttingPriorityCode=null;callCode=Default;sortQuery=openingDate;orderBy=asc;onlyTenders=false)}

Jupyter is an important piece of infrastructure for numerous projects funded
by the EU and its member states, including OpenDreamKit, PaNOSC, EOSC-life,
JEODPP \cite{Soille2018}, \TODO{citations? others?}... The \TheProject project
will thus act like a catalyst, increasing the potential impact of all these
projects, as well as hopefully many future projects, by strengthening a common
software platform.

\TODO{We should also go through the requirements from the call [1] and
  show how we address those [to provide easily accessible evidence
  that we are addressing the call].}
