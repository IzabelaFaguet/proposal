  By combining explanation with code and output, Jupyter notebooks are
  valuable tools for making scientific computing more reproducible.
  Reproducibility can build confidence in research results, and facilitate
  future research building on those results.
  However, the code in a notebook invariably relies on external code: libraries
  and programs which are not saved as part of the notebook.
  This task concerns ways to record the versions of these tools in use, and to
  make sure them available for practical reproduction of the computation.
  The task includes the following activities
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item ...
    (\delivref{workpackage}{deliv-id})
  \end{compactitem}
\end{task}
