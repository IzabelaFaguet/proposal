% UPSud involvement: UPSud has a geoscience group (GEOPS) and will be
% interested in using the tools developed here. No formal PM.

This task coordinates the work of the other \WPref{applications}
tasks. This will help us to exploit synergies, coordinate the
gathering and formulation of requirements,
writing of the deliverables, and supports demonstrator efforts to
speed-up the development process and ease the deployment of innovative
services. This task will drive the co-design cycle between
\WPref{applications} and all the technical work packages
(\WPref{core}, \WPref{ecosystem} and \WPref{eosc}).

\begin{compactitem}
\item Assess co-design efforts and distribute workload across the core
  developers
\item Regularly feedback information to \WPref{education} to adapt
  trainings and dissemination
\item Offer technical support to the demonstrators throughout all the
  steps until final deployment of the services
\end{compactitem}
