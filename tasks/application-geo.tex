% Scientific description

The Geoscience field covers a wide range of disciplines, from deep
mantle processes to atmospheric sciences, and all these activities are
actually studied at the Department of Geosciences of the University of
Oslo. In this regard, being the widest ranging earth sciences
department in Norway, it is a unique “living” laboratory for the
BOSSEE project. Some of the research groups are still virtually in the
“stone age” in terms of digitization, and as far as can be from open
and reproducible science. At the other extreme, other groups already
had to make significant steps towards reproducible science with the
use of complex numerical tools and huge amount of data necessarily
shared within their community through National/International computing
and storage infrastructures.
\TODO{Can you add a figure that shows some typical data? Or the data
  in a notebook?}

Two transversal and strategic research initiatives, namely LATICE
(Land-Atmosphere Interactions in Cold Environments) and EarthFlows
(Interface Dynamics in Geophysical Flows) intertwine these groups,
although technical issues hinder the full exploitation of these
multidisciplinary aspects.

% Technical description of tasks
The goal of this task is to select, develop and adapt Jupyter
ecosystem tools to facilitate transversal research in geoscience, and
will include activities around:

  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Mapping tools for visualization of in-situ and model generated
    data (Land, river-runoff, ocean, ice, wave and atmosphere models,
    particle dispersion models, oil spill models, etc.)  at
    high-latitudes and polar regions

  \item 3-D visualization for instance to display volcanic plumes
    (injection of aerosols in the various atmospheric layers), the
    quasi biennial oscillation (inversion of the wind direction in the
    tropical stratosphere), atmospheric rivers (flowing column of
    condensed water vapour in the atmosphere) and also at smaller
    scales to visualize 3D discrete particle simulations of sheared
    granular fault zones \TODO{Good to have QuantStack on board
      here. Is there a technical task on Widgets in WP2 or 3, that is
      linked to this application? If so, please mention.}
  \item “Laboratory” notebooks with concurrent editing, annotation and
    easy integration of information/correction observed during field
    trips \TODO{Concurrent editing links to real-time editing from the
    core WP2 - mention link?}
  \item One-click button for reproducing, cloning and archiving
    workflows to support multidisciplinary activities \TODO{Is this
      based on Binder?}
   \item Sharing read-only notebook-based interactive dashboards for
     novices \TODO{This sound like the Voila application from
       Quantstack -- please check with Sylvain, and make Quantstack a
       partner for this task.}
    (\localdelivref{geoscience})
  \end{compactitem}

  All these developments will be used both for scientific research and
  in the classroom for teaching master's students with best practices
  in open science.

  The Geosciences use case will make it possible to demonstrate the
  effectiveness of the BOSSEE co-design approach. The main challenges
  will be on the one hand to learn to take advantage of feedback given
  by users (either novices or experts) and on the other hand for
  BOSSEE developers to adapt their communication and language as well
  as their offer to the Geoscience. This will lead the way for
  on-boarding new communities.

  \TODO{The transversal research plays into the desired ``services that
    encourate collaborative interdisciplinary work'' that are desired
    by this call; this is good. Can you imagine that some of these
    facilities can be used via the EOSC? That would be a good
    addition. For example, one could use the BinderHub installation
    that we expect on the EOSC. }
