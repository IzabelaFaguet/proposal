\begin{task}[
  title=Server-side Document State,
  id=server-state,
  lead=UPSUD,
  PM=20,
  wphases={0-48},
  partners={UPSUD,SRL,QS}
]
  For applications such as real-time collaboration and others,
  it can be beneficial.
  We will explore different possible mechanisms for moving document state
  to the server-side in JupyterLab.
