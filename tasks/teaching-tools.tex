  wphases={0-48},
  partners={EP,UPSUD}]

  The partners will be delivering a large number of courses using
  Jupyter technology. This will require tools for easy sharing,
  collecting, self assessment and semi-automatic grading of course
  material, class management, and integration with the local
  e-learning infrastructure. The variety of use cases and
  infrastructure will provide a rich test bed for the further
  development of tools (nbgrader, okpy, ...) and best practices around
  them.

  \TODO{review existing tools; mention what needs to be done, and
    specific actions to be taken}

  The task includes the following activities:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Review and follow up on related efforts: gryd.us, cocalc, fun,
    Berkeley, ...
  \item Collaborative grade management
  \item Insulation through container of the automatic grading
  \item Integration with e-learning platforms (e.g. Moodle, OpenEDX
    (Coursera/Fun)), through an LTI connector.
    \TODO{explore the existing \url{https://github.com/ibleducation/jupyter-edx-grader-xblock}}
