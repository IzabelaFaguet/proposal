This task will be in charge of:

 
  \begin{compactitem}

   \item Defining and implementing a strategy to enable a shared vision of the Jupyter ecosystem across all the actors from developers, users to every stakeholder: the current misalignment hinders the full exploitation of Open Software practices where co-design is a de facto approach.

For instance, the official Jupyter documentation (https://jupyter.org/documentation) solely reflects the view of developers where the Jupyter ecosystem is defined as a set of software packages (jupyter-core, jupyter-client, kernels, widgets (ipywidgets, ipyleaflet, etc.). The user vision is relegated to examplars (blogs, newsletters, etc.) which inevitably tend to be restrictive but often become de facto standards. This can lead to misconceptions and makes it more difficult for on-boarding novices and new communities.

 

    (\localdelivref{deliv-id})
Deliverable: this document will explain the strategy and give details on how it will be implemented.

Milestone: release of a common documentation with a shared vision of the Jupyter ecosystem.

 

\item Triggering a cultural change to help under-represented groups to actively participate to the development of open source project to ensure the sustainability of the BOSSEE services deployed on EOSC-HUB. 
 

    (\localdelivref{deliv-id})
Deliverable: guideline for creating inclusive virtual community for Open Source projects (jupyter certified components will clearly have a link to the Jupyter code of conduct, guidelines on how to contribute guidelines, etc.)

 

\item Foster Open innovation by collaborating with others from different background and activities (school, universities, industries, journalists, artists, etc.)

  \end{compactitem}
 

To achieve these goals, the following actions/activities will take place:

 

  \begin{compactitem}
   \item co-design hackathons (x)

   \item Workshops on FAIR software and data for the adoption of Open Science best practices (transparent, sharable and collaborative Science): this would not be restricted to the Jupyter ecosystem and will teach users how to make data, lab notes and other research processes freely available, under terms that enable reuse (licensing), redistribution and reproducibility of methods and/or results.

   \item Open call for open innovation mini-projects: mentored by BOSSEE staff and targeting SMEs, municipalities, journalists, artists, etc.

  \end{compactitem}
