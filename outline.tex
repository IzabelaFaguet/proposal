% \subsection*{Mission statement for the grant}

% Our mission is to promote the next generation of community-developed
% open source software, databases, and services adapted to the needs of
% collaborative research in pure mathematics and applications.

% Our research will cover a wide variety of aspects, ranging from
% software development models, user interfaces \TODO{virtual
%   environments?}, deployment frameworks and novel collaborative tools,
% component architecture, design, and standardization of software
% \TODO{system?} and databases, to links to publication, data archival
% and reproducibility of experiments, development models and tools, and
% social aspects.

% It will consolidate Europe's leading position in computational
% mathematics and build on the remarkable success of the ecosystem of
% projects GAP, Python/Sage, Pari, Singular, LMFDB.
