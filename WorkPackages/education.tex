\begin{wpdescription}

Open science is entirely dependent on researchers adopting open practices.
In \TheProject, we are developing tools to facilitate these practices,
but they only work if researchers actually adopt them.
To this end, we will develop materials and run workshops,
training researchers.
Open science is not just of value to researchers, however.
One of the largest benefits of open science is that it makes science accessible to the broader public
who may not be members of the research community.
In addition to training researchers,
we will also train the public in how to make use of the open science research and services facilitated by \TheProject.
