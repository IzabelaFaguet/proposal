\begin{wpdescription}

In order to ensure that the work we do is beneficial to science and society,
we will develop applications in diverse domains,
using the components developed in work packages \TOWRITE{ref core and ecosystem}.

By developing applications simultaneously with the core infrastructure and services,
we ensure that we are serving real-world use cases with our development.
Feedback from applications development can guide development of core features.
In addition to helping ensure that our work is useful to the chosen application domains,
the applications serve as demonstrations of this utility.

One of the key aspects of Jupyter that make it the choice for \TheProject,
is that it is generic, and widely useful in diverse domains,
from physics to life sciences to education and the global community working with public and private data.
We make sure to select applications in a variety of domains to demonstrate the broad impact of \TheProject.
