  The objectives of this work package are
 \begin{compactitem}
   \item to guide the development of core tools by simultaneously
     developing and using applications in diverse fields with active
     scientists from these fields, and
   \item demonstrate that the tools we develop are valuable to diverse
     fields of science, thus ensuring we develop e-infrastructure and
     services which can cater for a broad customer base of EOSC.
 \end{compactitem}
\end{wpobjectives}

\begin{wpdescription}

  Whilst the components issued from work packages  \WPref{core} and \WPref{ecosystem} will be
  made available as generic EOSC services, this work package aims at deploying additional bespoke EOSC services
  targeting real-world cases.

  We have selected a number of applications in a variety of domains
  to demonstrate the broad impact of \TheProject, in particular in the
  areas of education (\localtaskref{teaching}), photon science and
  imaging (\localtaskref{reproducibility-xfel}), astronomy
  (\localtaskref{astro}), geosciences (\localtaskref{geoscience}), 
  fluid dynamics (\localtaskref{application-gpu}), 
  mathematics (\localtaskref{math}) and health (\localtaskref{opendose-analysis}).

  Working closely with the core developers of the Jupyter ecosystem will make it possible to 
  go way beyond what is normally available "out-of-the-box" and to offer better solutions, 
  thereby guiding further development of the core features.

  \medskip
  Our demonstrators will typically undergo two-stages: (i)
  development and testing of the services locally at the developing partner 
  site. (ii) Making the service available through the European Open 
  Science Cloud (EOSC).

  All demonstrators will deliver base-line services by making the
  relevant notebooks executable in the \emph{European Binder Service} instance that this
  project will deployed on EOSC. This will demonstrate
  the Jupyter service capabilities such as reproducibility, interactive
  widget use and visualisation, and show how these can
  enable new open science on EOSC.

  The particular workflows, data infrastructures and data policies for
  FAIR\footnote{Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable} sharing of data vary from one community and use-case to
  the other, or may not be fully defined yet. Therefore, this proposal
  does not enforce a specific way of handling data. Instead we
  will explore in the demonstrator tasks how existing data policies,
  infrastructure and workflows can be respected and integrated with
  authentication and authorisation, data management, and
  JupyterHub/Binder services on EOSC. EGI is a partner
  for all the tasks in this work package and will work with us to find the
  best integration solutions in the evolving EOSC
  infrastructure.

  For some of the demonstrators, authentication and authorization and/or
  data management are being addressed outside \TheProject.
  This is for instance the case for the photon science and astronomy
  demonstrators via \href{https://panosc-eu.github.io/}{PaNOSC} and 
  \href{https://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann18084/}{ESCAPE} projects, respectively.
