\subsection{Expected Impacts}

\eucommentary{Please be specific, and provide only information that applies
to the proposal and its objectives. Wherever possible, use quantified
indicators and targets.\\
Describe how your project will contribute to:\\
-- the expected impacts set out in the work programme, under the relevant topic
(including key performance indicators/metrics for monitoring results and impacts);\\
-- improving innovation capacity and the integration of new knowledge
(strengthening the competitiveness and growth of companies by developing
innovations meeting the needs of European and global markets; and, where
relevant, by delivering such innovations to the markets;\\
-- any other environmental and socially important impacts (if not already
covered above).\\
Describe any barriers/obstacles, and any framework conditions (such as
regulation and standards), that may determine whether and to what extent
the expected impacts will be achieved. (This should not include any risk
factors concerning implementation, as covered in section 3.2.)}

\eucommentary{Expected impact: Integrating co-design into research and
development of new services to better support scientific, industrial and
societal applications benefiting from a strong user orientation;}

The Jupyter tools have always been driven by a close connection to users; since
the project began as IPython in 2001, many of the developers have been
scientific researchers using the tools as they developed them. More recently,
when Jupyter has benefitted from dedicated developer time, developers have
remained in academic institutions, in the kind of role now referred to as
'research software engineers', allowing day-to-day interactions with
researchers using Jupyter in a wide range of fields.

\eucommentary{Expected impact: Supporting the objectives of Open Science by
improving access to content and resources, and facilitating interdisciplinary
collaborations;}

\eucommentary{Expected impact: Fostering the innovation potential by opening up
the EOSC ecosystem of e-infrastructure service providers to new innovative
actors}
