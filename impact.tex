\subsection{Expected Impacts}

\eucommentary{Please be specific, and provide only information that applies
to the proposal and its objectives. Wherever possible, use quantified
indicators and targets.\\
Describe how your project will contribute to:\\
-- the expected impacts set out in the work programme, under the relevant topic
(including key performance indicators/metrics for monitoring results and impacts);\\
-- improving innovation capacity and the integration of new knowledge
(strengthening the competitiveness and growth of companies by developing
innovations meeting the needs of European and global markets; and, where
relevant, by delivering such innovations to the markets;\\
-- any other environmental and socially important impacts (if not already
covered above).\\
Describe any barriers/obstacles, and any framework conditions (such as
regulation and standards), that may determine whether and to what extent
the expected impacts will be achieved. (This should not include any risk
factors concerning implementation, as covered in section 3.2.)}
